You succeeded at robbing!
You stole some money. Nice.
As your victim looked the other way, you stole his wallet! It was in his hand, too. Impressive.
You broke into your victim's house late at night, and stole money from their safe. Why do they even have a safe?
You put ransomware on your victim's Mac. They are *not* immune to viruses.
Your victim got tricked into calling you, "Windows", after you froze their PC. You sold them fake AV software, and took their money.
You tried to break into your victim's bank vault. It didn't work, so you turned around and grabbed their wallet instead. Yes, they were behind you the whole time. Pretty stupid. At least you had a mask...
