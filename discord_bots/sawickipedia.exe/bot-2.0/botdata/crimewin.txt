You crimed. You won. Nice.
Filthy criminal; you got money.
The guy next door has really loud bass throbbing in the middle of the night, constantly. You stole his speakers and stole them to make some money, and enjoy the silence.
You saw your grandmother yesterday! She left her purse with you while she went to the bathroom.
You hacked Hilary Clinton's emails. You sold them to a Trump supporter.
You tried to assassinate the president. You failed, but some idiot believed you and gave you some cash as thanks.
You created a Tech Support Scam, and started calling some old ladies. Your Indian accent paid off, and you sold some fake software!
You saw a guy walking down an alleyway at night, looking sketchy. You threaten him, and he gives you his weed. You then sold it to the next guy coming down that alleyway.
You stole some records from a guy's garage. People are crazy, and paid a lot of money for them.
You tried to rob a bank, but couldn't open the safe. Luckily, there was a cash register nearby.
You pirated some games and sold them.
You dog decided to bite a guy the other day. That guy paid you to shoot your dog. Like the horrible monster you are, you accepted.
You robbed from a different currency bot!
You pirated Doki Doki Literature club and sold it to a couple weebs. You then got more money from the inevitable therapy sessions that resulted, even though you're not a Doctor (probably). In any case, malpractice. You did it, though.
