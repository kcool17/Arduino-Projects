You failed at robbing!
You were fined. Oops.
You put on your best robber outfit, and went to your victim's house. Why'd you wear a robber outfit!?
You took the wallet out of your victim's back pocket, and tried to run away. You tripped. They took their wallet back, *and* your wallet. Don't rob the robber.
You tried to rob your victim as they were pulled over. By a police car. Are you ok?
Seriously, stop robbing. You got caught. Again. Be better next time.
