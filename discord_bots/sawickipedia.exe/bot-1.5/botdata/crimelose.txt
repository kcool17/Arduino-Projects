You crimed. You lost. Oof.
Criminal scum; you lost money.
You tried to escape Libyan terrorists, but you went 88 MPH. The plutonium from 2085 still cost a fair amount, though.
You tried to kill a funny skeleton. You had a bad time.
You tried to prostitute yourself for a married guy. Too bad they're a good person, and a devout Catholic.
You attempted a Tech Support Scam. Unfortunantely, you didn't spoof your phone, and you called me.
You tried to pirate a Nintendo game. Too bad it's Nintendo.
Whilst escaping from the cops, you tripped over your own shoelaces. In a car. I don't even know how you managed that.
You killed your S.O. You got caught. You deserved it.
You went on 4chan without Incognito mode. How stupid.
You decided to watch hentai, since that's the kind of person you are. Too bad they were lolis, you live in America, and you already were on an FBI watch list.
You brought your white van filled with candy to the park. How stupid are you?
You went on the Dark Web, but forgot Incognito mode. You imbecile.
You killed a cat. You deserve death, but you were only fined. You'll be sorry when I take over.
You tried to steal from me. Nice try.
You got caught being a pedophile. You deserve far worse than this.
You never wanted a sibling. Your parents just found out. You no longer have any siblings.
You tried to buy drugs from a police officer. Smart.
Hello, Mr. Cosby.
You taught your dog to Nazi Salute. In the UK. Oops.
For some reason, you decided to pirate a free game. It was Doki Doki Literature club. Since you're an ignorant weeb, you thought it was a dating sim, and got excited. Your favorites were Sayori and Yuri. Not only did you get fined for using the Pirate Bay on your school account, but you also had to pay for those therapy sessions.
